# AI Agent Prompt: Build a Calorie Tracker Desktop Application

## Project Overview
Create a standalone desktop application in Python that tracks daily calorie intake, macro nutrients, weight, and calorie goals. The application should store all data in a spreadsheet format and provide functionality for data entry and visualization over time.

---

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Python
- **Application Type**: Standalone Desktop Application
- **Deployment**: Must include an executable file that launches the application
- **Data Storage**: Spreadsheet file (Excel or CSV format)
  - The application must automatically create the spreadsheet if it doesn't exist
  - All user data should persist between sessions

---

## Core Features

### 1. Data Tracking
**Description**: The application tracks the following data points for each day:
- **Date**: The specific day for the entry
- **Calories**: Total calorie intake for the day
- **Macro Nutrients**: 
  - Protein (grams)
  - Carbohydrates (grams)
  - Fat (grams)
- **Daily Weight**: User's weight measurement for the day (pounds or kilograms)
- **Calorie Goal**: Target calorie intake for the day

**Implementation Details**:
- Each row in the spreadsheet represents one day
- Data should be organized with columns for: Date, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Weight, Calorie Goal
- The application should handle creating the spreadsheet with proper headers if it doesn't exist

---

### 2. Data Entry and Updates
**Description**: Users can add or update their tracking data for any given day.

**Functionality**:
- **Incremental Calorie Updates**: Users can add calories to an existing day's total
  - Example: If current total is 1000 calories and user eats a banana (80 calories), they can add 80 to reach 1080 total
- **Incremental Macro Nutrient Updates**: Users can add to existing macro nutrient totals for the day
- **Weight Entry**: Users can enter or update their weight for a specific day
- **Calorie Goal Setting**: Users can set or modify the calorie goal for any day
- **Date Selection**: Users can select which date they want to update (current day or historical dates)

**User Experience**:
- The interface should make it easy to quickly add values to the current day
- Users should be able to view current totals before adding new values
- The application should prevent duplicate entries for the same day (update existing entry instead)

---

### 3. Data Visualization and Reporting
**Description**: Users can view their tracking data over time through charts and reports.

**Visualization Options**:
- **Weight Over Time**: Line chart showing weight progression across selected date range
- **Calorie Intake Over Time**: Line chart showing daily calorie consumption
- **Macro Nutrients Over Time**: Chart displaying protein, carbs, and fat trends
- **Goal vs. Actual Comparison**: Chart comparing calorie goal against actual calorie intake
  - Should clearly show days where goal was met, exceeded, or not reached
  - Could include a difference/variance visualization

**Report Features**:
- Users should be able to select date ranges for visualization (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range)
- Display summary statistics (averages, totals, trends)
- Charts should be clear, labeled, and easy to interpret

---

### 4. Spreadsheet Management
**Description**: The application manages the underlying spreadsheet data file.

**Functionality**:
- **Auto-Creation**: If the spreadsheet file doesn't exist on first launch, create it with proper structure
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity when reading and writing to the spreadsheet
- **File Location**: The spreadsheet should be stored in a predictable location (e.g., same directory as executable or user's documents folder)
- **Backup Consideration**: (Optional) Ability to backup or export the spreadsheet

---

### 5. User Interface
**Description**: A desktop GUI that is intuitive and easy to use.

**Requirements**:
- Clean, organized layout
- Clear sections for:
  - Data entry (add/update values)
  - Data visualization (view charts and reports)
  - Settings or preferences (if needed)
- Appropriate input validation and error messages
- Responsive to user actions

**Suggested Python GUI Framework**:
- Tkinter (built-in, good for simple apps)
- PyQt5/PyQt6 (more advanced, professional look)
- Kivy (cross-platform)
- CustomTkinter (modern-looking Tkinter variant)

## Data Model Structure

### Spreadsheet Columns:
| Date | Calories | Protein (g) | Carbs (g) | Fat (g) | Weight | Calorie Goal |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Integer | Decimal | Decimal | Decimal | Decimal | Integer |

---

## Deliverables

1. **Python Source Code**: All application code properly organized
2. **Executable File**: A standalone .exe (Windows) or equivalent for other OS
3. **README**: Instructions for:
   - How to run the executable
   - How to use the application
   - Where data is stored
   - Any dependencies or requirements
4. **Sample Spreadsheet**: An example of the data structure (optional)

---

## Additional Considerations

### Error Handling:
- Handle missing or corrupted spreadsheet files
- Validate user inputs (no negative calories, valid dates, etc.)
- Graceful error messages for file I/O issues

### Data Persistence:
- Ensure all changes are saved to the spreadsheet immediately or with a clear save action
- Confirm data is written successfully

### User Experience Enhancements (Optional):
- Default to current date for quick entry
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Recent entries display
- Calorie calculator or food database integration (future feature)

---

## Success Criteria

The application is complete when:
1. It launches via executable without requiring Python installation
2. It creates and manages a spreadsheet for data storage
3. Users can add/update calories, macros, weight, and goals for any date
4. Users can visualize their data over time through charts
5. Data persists between sessions
6. The interface is intuitive and functional
